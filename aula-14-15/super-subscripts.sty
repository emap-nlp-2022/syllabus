% This is part of the standard gb4e.sty, but I took it out there since
% it causes too many incompatibilities. So it can be loaded separately
% if one wants to use it.

% this allows _ to be used in horizontal mode (from J.Frampton):
\catcode`_=\active
\def_#1{\ifmmode\mathit{\sb{#1}}\else${}\sb{#1}$\fi}
\catcode`^=\active
\def^#1{\ifmmode\mathit{\sp{#1}}\else${}\sp{#1}$\fi}
